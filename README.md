# Vietnamese Speaker Recognition Application

## Overview
Speaker Recognition is a crucial field within speech and natural language processing. It represents a widely applicable problem across various real-world applications, such as speaker identification within voice authentication systems, automated phone systems, enhancing user experience in artificial intelligence applications, among others. Particularly, with the development of AI-driven services and voice communication, speaker recognition is becoming increasingly significant.

Within the scope of this project, the focus lies on speaker recognition in the Vietnamese language. The goal is to identify and verify the identity of speakers based on their voice characteristics. This can be applicable in scenarios such as account authentication, personal information security, and various other applications.

## Features
- **Speaker Identification:** Accurately identifies and categorizes speakers within audio recordings.
- **Deep Learning Models:** Uses advanced neural networks to process and analyze audio data.
- **Versatile Applications:** Applicable in security systems, voice recording archives, and user authentication processes.

## Dataset
- The VIVOS dataset is a valuable resource for research in Automatic Vietnamese Speech Recognition. Compiled by AILAB, a computer science laboratory at the University of Science - Vietnam National University Ho Chi Minh City (VNUHCM), Professor Vu Hai Quan leads this project.

- This dataset can be utilized for research and development of applications related to Vietnamese speech. It has been made available for free, aiming to attract more scientists to address issues in Vietnamese speech recognition.
